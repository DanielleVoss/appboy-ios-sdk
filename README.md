## Upgrading

This version of the SDK should only be used if you are upgrading from a previous installation of v1 of the Appboy iOS SDK. It is highly recommended that any customers looking to upgrade their installation of the v1 SDK instead switch to the latest release of our v2 SDK available at https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk . However, if you need to upgrade v1 to incorporate a hotfix into your existing installation, these directions will help you with the upgrade process.

1. Clean your build folder.
2. Clone or fetch the latest copy of the v1-master branch at https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/tree/v1-master
3. Replace the entire contents of your AppboyRelease folder in your project with the contents of the AppboyRelease folder from your Github checkout.
4. Clean and rebuild your project.
